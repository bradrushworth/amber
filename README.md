# Amber Electric Dashboard

[Visualise your Amber Electric electricity consumption](https://amberelectric.codemagic.app/)
using this flutter dashboard. It's available on
[web](https://amberelectric.codemagic.app/),
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.bitbot.amber), and
[iOS/iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/amber-dashboard/id6462788425).
It can be built and packaged for Linux and Windows also if anybody requires that, but I'd need to automate the relevant store uploads.

## About Amber Electric

[Amber Electric](https://amber.com.au/) is an innovative energy retailer in
Australia which gives customers access to the wholesale energy price as
determined by the National Energy Market.

This gives customers the opportunity to reduce their bills and their reliance
on fossil fuels by shifting their biggest energy usage to times of the day when
energy is cheaper and greener.

### Amber's API

Amber gives customers access to a LOT of their own data through their public
Application Programming Interface or API.

This tool relies on you having access to Amber's API, which means you need
to be an Amber customer, and you need to get an API token.
But that's pretty easy.
[Start here](https://help.amber.com.au/hc/en-us/articles/360038985552-Do-you-have-an-API-).

Amber has started to support 5 minute billing periods now for some customers.
The app should be able to automatically detect and support all users regardless of whether
they are on 30 minute or 5 minute billing periods.
