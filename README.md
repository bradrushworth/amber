[Visualise your Amber Electric electricity consumption](https://amberelectric.codemagic.app/)
using this flutter dashboard. It's available on
[web](https://amberelectric.codemagic.app/),
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.bitbot.amber), and
[iOS/iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/amber-dashboard/id6462788425).
It can be built and packaged for Linux and Windows also if anybody requires that, but I'd need to automate the relevant store uploads.
