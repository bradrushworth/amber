[Visualise your Momentum Energy electricity consumption](https://momentumenergy.codemagic.app/)
using this flutter dashboard. Just download your usage file (
e.g.&nbsp;`Your_Usage_List_202201071739166144.csv`) with the longest time period that suits you,
from the [MyAccount Portal](https://www.momentumenergy.com.au/myaccount/my-usage) and then upload it
to the app with the _Upload File_ link. The file stays locally on your device/computer and is
processed by your browser.

If you are having problems downloading CSV files from Momentum Energy, where the file is empty other
than a single error message, please try using a shorter time period. The export feature appears to
be very unreliable and unfortunately there is nothing I can do about it. Try to keep the export to
only a small number of weeks.
